## Description

**LI**nk **CO**ntroller (alias **LICO**) is a configurable utility for monitoring the status of the links of the sotwares that make up a pipeline.

LICO consists of a bash script that perform the monitoring.

LICO relies on:

1) [cron](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-cron-to-automate-tasks-ubuntu-1804): a job scheduler;
2) [telegram-send](https://pypi.org/project/telegram-send/): a command-line tool to send messages over Telegram to your account.

While **cron** schedules the frequency at which yuo want to monitor your links status, **telegram-send** sends you a report of the status of your links.

# WHAT YOU NEED

1. COPY ```monitor.sh``` inside your ```/favorite/dir ```
2. RENAME ```monitor.sh``` if you want.

## CRON and TELEGRAM-SEND
Install both *cron* and *telegram-send* following the installation instructions from the links above,

## CREATE A BOT ON TELEGRAM
From the command line run 
  ```
telegram-send --configure
  ```
the steps to follow will be printed on the shell.

## CONFIGURE CRON
*cron* needs to know how frequently you want to run ```monitor.sh```.

Change the configuration file of *cron* running ```crontab -e``` and add, for example:

```
0 0 1 */1 *  bash /favorite/dir/monitor.sh
```

The meaning of ```0 0 1 */1 *``` can be found by copy-pate the code in the searchbar at [CronTab.guru](https://crontab.guru/).<br>
Using this setup,```monitor.sh``` will run silently in the background on the 1<sup>st</sup> of each month at midnight ðŸŒ•.<br>
At the end of the run, the telegram bot sends the report to you.
